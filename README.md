## Abstract

Machine Readable Datasheet (MRD) defines a machine-readable format for the parts of a device description that firmware actually depends on. It pulls together the details engineers usually chase across datasheets, reference manuals, and errata, then puts them in a form that tools and reviewers can reuse.

MRD focuses on firmware-relevant device data: pins, pad functions, registers, fields, interfaces, constraints, conflicts, and errata. It is not trying to replace a vendor datasheet. It is trying to capture the operational details software depends on.

## 1. Scope

MRD may describe:

* device identity and revisions
* packages, pads, and pins
* pin multiplexing rules
* registers and fields
* peripheral blocks
* clocks, resets, interrupts, DMA
* interface instances
* electrical and functional constraints
* errata and workarounds
* traceability to source documentation

* * *

## 2. Why MRD Matters

The data firmware needs is scattered. Engineers jump between PDFs, code examples, app notes, and errata just to confirm what a device can do and what firmware is allowed to assume.

MRD establishes a reusable hardware contract so that generators and reviewers are not forced to rediscover the same rules every time.

MRD establishes what a device or pin can do.
MRC establishes what that device or pin is actually connected to in a board design.
